# RTL-design-and-Synthesis-Workshop
Workshop documentation 

Overview:

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a major shift towards open-source toolchains and PDKs like SKY130 for chip prototyping and tapeout.
This workshop empowers one to master Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, simulation, and synthesis using industry-aligned open-source tools.
In short, this workshop intends to teach the Verilog coding guidelines that result in predictable logic in Silicon.

Over 10 days, I have:
Learnt Verilog RTL from scratch
Simulated designs using Iverilog and GTKWave
Performed logic synthesis with Yosys
Understood how RTL gets mapped to logic gates in real silicon
Gained exposure to ASIC design flows using the SKY130 PDK

Modulewise Content
Module 1: Intro to Verilog and HDL simulation with iverilog and GTKWave
Module 2: RTL coding styles, module design, and simulation debugging
Module 3: RTL design labs and testbenches for digital blocks
Module 4: Introduction to Yosys and Synthesis Concepts
Module 5: RTL to gate-level netlist using Yosys with SKY130 standard cells
